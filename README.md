# Day-Planner

This is a Day Planner for the hours of a normal workday. It has input fields for each hour where the user can type in data. That data is saved to local storage once the saved button for that time slot is clicked, and the data remains in the time slot when the page is refreshed. The current date is displayed at the top of the page, and each time slot is color coded as follows: grey if the time is in the past, red if it is present, and green if it is in the future. Click on 6pm to see what the plan is for that time(you'll have to scroll down after you click on 6pm, and make sure you have your audio enabled.)
